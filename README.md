# Radio Voice Effect ðŸŽ™

A python script that takes a directory full of voicelines and adds a walkie-talkie/radio effect to all of them.

I wrote this for a game that I'm working on called "In Pursuit" which features a gamemode where you have to survive an endless police pursuit. It features law-enforcement radio chatter and adding the radio effect manually to dozens of soundclips was a tedious process.

I couldn't find anything similar online so I'm open-sourcing this program in hopes someone may find it helpful. I may work on a GUI and add more features to it later.
